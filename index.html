        <h3>Our Department</h3>
      <p>Consistently ranked among the top computer science programs in the nation, the Department of Computer Science (CS) at Stony Brook University has a proud history and even brighter future. Our undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs have welcomed students from all around the world for decades (since 1969) and over 8,500 people happily call themselves alumni of the department. These notable alumni include John Hennessy '75 MS '77 PhD, former president of Stanford University; Jon Oringer 'BS 96, CEO and Founder of Shutterstock, Inc; and Ben Shneiderman '78 PhD, our first PhD recipient and creator of the hyperlink. </p>
      <p>The department is the largest unit in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and is usually in the top three departments on campus in terms of size and course offerings. Our 50+ faculty and students work closely in an open, and collegial atmosphere. The department is active in many of the major research areas in computer science including artificial intelligence, visual computing, computer systems, networking, cybersecurity, data science, logic programming and deductive systems, and algorithms.</p>
